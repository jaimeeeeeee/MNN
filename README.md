We wanted to inform our audience on how serious natural disasters can be.  We believe it’s important for people to know that there are resources for them when struggling from natural disasters
In order to have a successful app, we believe creativity is key.  We value using our imagination to the fullest so that our user of the app can enjoy their experience, while learning how to prepare in case of an emergency.

Our Mohu News Network app relates to first response because it informs the audience on how to stay prepared for a natural disaster.  The Mohu News Network is much different than any other news network because it is specifically dedicated to helping it’s viewers stay safe during natural disasters, not just a daily weather report.  Our goal was to provide an informative resource for those who are struggling in severe weather or for those who want to anticipate and avoid it.
We especially stand out because we are a full group of sophomores who wanted to make an efficient, impactful app without using AI.  Our app represents each of our members while still motivating our audience for a good cause.  As a group of sophomores, we have little computer science experience and wanted to use this opportunity to grow our knowledge in coding.  Additionally, we knew a lot of our competitors would be mainly using AI, however we wanted to embrace individualism by creating something we appreciate with our own knowledge.
